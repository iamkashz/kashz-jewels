## <mark style="color:blue;">About this book</mark>

This book is an organized collection of notes that I prefer not keep searching on Google every time I come across
something from the past. I started this mainly to have a wholesome documentation for **(my OSCP exam and) solving
CTF-challenges whether on HackTheBox or in competitions.** I'm looking to join a CTF team and actively solve challenges.
**If you're looking for a team member, DM on discord.**

Honestly, **all the content available here is present on the internet just not organized like this**, I just happen to
come across them while solving boxes and wanted to have it **organized** to come back to at a later date if I need it.
That's how this book started and has grown overtime.

Special mention to [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) as some of my pages directly link there for guide which
explains way better.

## :warning: <mark style="color:red;">DISCLAIMER</mark> :warning:

My notes reflect **my understanding** and how I have used the commands/tools. I may be wrong or misunderstood something.

Some of my sections are very detailed, organized and others are chaos. Overtime I'll try to clean my notes. As I come
across something more often, the more clean the notes will be.
